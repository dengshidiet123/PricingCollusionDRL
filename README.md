# PricingCollusionDRL

## Overview
PricingCollusionDRL is a research project that implements Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms to investigate pricing collusion in different market models, including Standard Bertrand, Edgeworth Bertrand, and Bertrand model with logit demand. The project also includes Tabular Q-learning algorithm implementations.
